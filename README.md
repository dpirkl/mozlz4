# mozilla jsonlz4 decompression

This can be used to decompress Firefox backup files. Thanks to [teashd's GitHub repo](https://github.com/toashd/mozlz4). I simply converted the code to python and added the markdown export option.

I use it to decompress Firefox bookmark backups, save them in a markdown file and store them in case something happens to my laptop.
